# xepersian
Persian for LaTeX, using XeTeX

## CTAN Package
 https://www.ctan.org/pkg/xepersian



## Maintenance
Vafa Khalighi, who was maintaining xepersian, handed maintenance to this bidi-tex
GitHub Group (which initially consists of members of the LaTeX3 team).

Issues may be entered here.

The files here should match the files on CTAN:

http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/xetex/latex/bidi.zip


This git repository was originally cloned from:

https://sourceforge.net/p/persian-tex-dist

### Note

Since handing over maintenance of these packages for personal reasons,
Vafa Kahlighi has found time to make some further updates (via the
bidirtex github repositories), changes made there will be merged
back to this canonical source.
