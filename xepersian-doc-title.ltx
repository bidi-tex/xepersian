If you want to report any bugs or typos and corrections in the documentation,
or ask for any new features, or suggest any improvements, then please do not send any direct email to me; I will not 
answer any direct email. Instead please use the issue tracker:

  \centerline{\url{https://sourceforge.net/p/persian-tex-dist/tickets}}

\medskip
In doing so, please always explain your issue well enough, and always include
a minimal working example showing the issue. 

\bigskip
Please note that most of my spare time is pretty much occupied by
\TeX{} development and as a result, I am afraid that I can not help users
on a regular basis. Therefore, I ask all users to not email me
and ask for help. However, there is a Persian \TeX{} mailing list where 
everyone can discuss Persian \TeX{} related topics, ask and/or answer questions. This mailing list is the default media for Persian \TeX{} 
communications. I will try my best to answer questions on this
mailing list whenever I have time.
You can subscribe to the mailing list at
